//This is an Local Wordpress Project called Fictional University - Developed by practising the following Udemy course

https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/ 

To run this project locally - Kindly create a new Wordpress project on Local by Flywheel and create a git repo under the app folder (git init) and delete the follwing 
files and git clone the deleted files from the repo to reproduce the exact project. 
1. app/public/wp-content/themes/*
2. app/public/readme.html

Then add the remote origin and pull the latest changes from the branch master: commands for the procedure are as follows,
1. git remote add origin 'https://github.com/alagu031325/wordpress_fictional_university_app.git'
2. git pull origin master

Only wp-content files which are added/changed are pushed to git to reduce the complexity of cloning the entire wordpress project from GIT.

Many thanks for understanding,
Alagu
